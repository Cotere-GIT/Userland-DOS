ULDOS or Userland DOS is a script that acts like a "shell" made in batch; It kills explorer and has many neat functions. It is also not that well made | France code inside "tm"

== WARNING; This may break your Operating System ==

To run ULDOS, type dos in a CMD window, it will request administrator privileges and run

to edit starting / reload apps edit C:/ULDOS/loadlist.ini

The installer has a UAC backup if the app isn't run as administrator, if you see a UAC window appear twice, 
the application hasn't been ran as administrator and requests Administrator permissions twice to run both CMD
scripts. Thank you for your understanding.
